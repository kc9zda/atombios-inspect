Atombios-inspect is an HTML5 page/application/whatever-you-want-to-call-it that takes a BIOS ROM image from an AMD graphics card and prints debug information about the image. It prints some data tables, and disassembles all commands. Most opcodes are supported, but not all were not tested.

Much of the information was reverse-engineered from the Atombios interpreters in the Linux source tree in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon and drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu.
